        "Ans. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",

        "Q2.What is an interpreter in Python         \n",
        "Ans An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It translates the high-level Python code into machine-readable instructions (bytecode), which the computer can understand and execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python       \n",
        "Ans Pre-defined keywords (also called reserved words) in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable or function names). These words are part of the Python language syntax and are used to define the structure and rules of Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.Can keywords be used as variable names      \n",
        "Ans You cannot use Python keywords as variable names because they are reserved for specific language functions. Always choose descriptive, non-keyword names for your variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5.  What is mutability in Python     \n",

        "Designed for fixed, constant data: Once created, the data cannot change.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use cases: Safer to use when data must stay constant, like keys in dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python     \n",
        "Ans  == checks value equality (do they contain the same data?)\n",
        "is checks object identity (are they the exact same object in memory?)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What are logical operators in Python     \n",
        "ans  Logical Operators in Python       \n",
        "In Python, logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and make decisions based on whether those conditions are true or false. There are three main logical operators: and, or, and not. The and operator returns True only if both conditions are true. For example, x > 5 and y < 10 will only be true if both parts of the condition are satisfied. The or operator returns True if at least one condition is true, so even if one condition is false, the overall result can still be true. The not operator is used to reverse the result of a condition — if a condition is true, not will make it false, and vice versa. These logical operators are essential for writing effective control flow statements like if, while, and for loops in Python programs.\n",

        "Q9.  What is type casting in Python     \n",
        "ans Type casting in Python refers to converting one data type into another. It allows you to change a variable's type, such as from a string to an integer, or a float to a string.\n",
        "\n",
        " Common Type Casting Functions:\n",
        "int() – Converts to integer\n",

        "Happens when no data loss is expected\n",

        "\n",
        "Q11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python     \n",
        "ans he purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by allowing it to make decisions based on certain conditions. They enable the program to execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are true, making the program dynamic and responsive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Conditional Statements:\n",
        "if: Runs a block if the condition is true.\n",

        "else: Runs if none of the previous conditions were true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. How does the elif statement work     \n",
        "ans The elif (short for else if) statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions after the initial if condition fails. It allows you to test several conditions in sequence, and the first one that is True will be executed. If none are true, the else block (if present) runs.\n",
